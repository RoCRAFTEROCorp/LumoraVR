// Four-legged body solver. A SIBLING of FullBodyIKSolver, never a subclass - that type is sealed and
// every limb slot in it is private, so there is nothing to extend and nothing to reach.
//
// It also cannot simply call the biped's SolveLeg four times, even though that method already takes its
// whole chain as parameters. Two lines inside it select per-limb state by BodyNode identity, so a third
// or fourth leg handed to it would silently inherit the RIGHT leg's captured bend plane and solve into
// the wrong side of the animal. Here that state lives in a LimbChain[4] instead, which is the one
// structural change that turns "two legs" into "any legs".
//
// Rotations only, with ONE exception: the pelvis root gets its position written. Writing positions on
// the other bones shears the skinned mesh under the armature's fit scale, and a quadruped has four legs
// to do it with, so those stay rotation-driven. The pelvis is the exception for the same reason the
// biped writes its hips: a solver that only rotates cannot stand a body up. The animal's height above
// the floor is whatever its hierarchy says, and a model whose origin sits at the body centre puts its
// legs through the floor with no rotation able to fix it. The pelvis write lifts the whole skeleton to
// its rest standing height over the ground plane, and it is a root bone, so there is no parent scale
// between it and the armature to shear against. -xlinka
//
// Lives in LumoraCore because Sync<T>.SetValueSilently is internal, and every bone write goes through
// it. There is no public bone-write path in the engine. -xlinka
